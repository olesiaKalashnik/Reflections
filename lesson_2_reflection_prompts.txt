What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initiate  repository, a separate hidden directory is being created, which will contain all the commits I'll make in the future. I need to do it to be able to have an access to the history of my project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers? 
Staging area is like a shopping cart, in which you put stuff that you select from your working directory in order to commit it to your git repository (like you check out your purchasesat the cash register). It gives you more control over the commit process, as it lets you pick seperate files that you prefer to commit.

change?
